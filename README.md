## Background and Problem Statement

Education is an integral factor in development or upliftment of any social group. It is also an essential
part of any humans’ life: that shapes their personal outlook and opinions and helps them progress. That
is why the dataset “Student Alcohol Consumption” was chosen by this group for our hackathon. This data
comprises of drinking habits, grades, demographic information and other social factors (parents’ education,
family size, relationship status, etc) for school-going students in Portugal from 2005-2006. Eurostat’s “Early
leavers from education and training by sex and labour status” data from 2007 shows Portugal’s early leaver
from education rate as 36.5% against European Union’s average of 15%, thus emphasizing the significance
of this subject and its analysis.

Even though Portugal has since pulled through their education crisis exhibiting dropout rate of 8.9% against
EU’s average of 9.9% in 2020, we aim to explore causation, relations and insights from students’ alcohol consumption habits, their grades, and social factors they may be affected by. This report is divided into three sections: **Understanding Student Audience in Mathematics class of Portuguese Schools, Analyzing
factors impacting alcohol consumption among math students in Portuguese Schools, Deep dive
into factors impacting grades among mathematics students in Portuguese Schools.**


In Understanding Student Audience in Mathematics class of Portuguese Schools, exploratory
data analysis is conducted on the dataset to understand the dataset, look for points of interest and determine what portion of the data should be explored next. Alcohol consumption habits of Portuguese students
are compared against demographic and social indicators such as age, parents’ jobs, social life in Analyzing
factors impacting alcohol consumption among math students in Portuguese Schools. Finally,
geographical, social and demographic data points like study time, travel time, health, and internet access are
compared to find trends affecting students’ grades and the aforementioned analysis on alcohol consumption
is used to determine relationship between students’ grades and alcohol consumption in Deep dive into
factors impacting grades among mathematics students in Portuguese Schools.
