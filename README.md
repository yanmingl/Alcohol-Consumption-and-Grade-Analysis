## Background and Problem Statement

Education is a crucial factor in the development and progress of any society, and its importance cannot be overstated. The acquisition of knowledge and skills is not only important for personal growth but also plays a critical role in shaping one's worldview and opinions. To this end, the "Student Alcohol Consumption" dataset was selected for our hackathon, as it provides valuable information on the drinking habits, grades, demographic information, and other social factors of school-going students in Portugal during 2005-2006. This dataset is particularly relevant given Portugal's historically high early-leaver rate from education and training, which reached 36.5% in 2007, well above the European Union average of 15%. Although Portugal has made significant strides in addressing its education crisis, with a dropout rate of 8.9% in 2020, we believe that analyzing factors that impact student alcohol consumption and academic performance can provide valuable insights into addressing educational challenges in Portugal.

Our report is divided into three sections. The first section, "Understanding Student Audience in Mathematics class of Portuguese Schools," focuses on exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, identify key areas of interest, and determine the next steps for analysis. The second section, "Analyzing factors impacting alcohol consumption among math students in Portuguese Schools," examines the relationship between Portuguese students' alcohol consumption habits and demographic and social factors, such as age, parents' jobs, and social life. Finally, the third section, "Deep dive into factors impacting grades among mathematics students in Portuguese Schools," explores the impact of geographical, social, and demographic data points, such as study time, travel time, health, and internet access, on students' academic performance. The analysis on alcohol consumption is then used to determine the relationship between students' grades and alcohol consumption.

Overall, our analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the factors that impact student alcohol consumption and academic performance in Portugal, with the ultimate goal of informing educational policy and practice.
